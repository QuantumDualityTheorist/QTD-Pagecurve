# QTD-Page-Curve

This repository contains the minimal Lindblad toy model from:

**A.C. Theorist, "Unitary Page Curve from a Single Entropy-Driven Lindblad Jump" (Dec 2025)**

## Contents

- `QTD_PageCurve.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook that reproduces the Page curve for evaporating black holes using a single entropy-driven Lindblad jump operator.

- `page_curve_final.pdf`  
  Output figure generated by the notebook, corresponding to Fig. 1 in the paper.

- `requirements.txt`  
  Python dependencies for reproducing results.

## Parameters

The notebook uses:

- `N = 4096` modes  
- `eta = 0.8` (entropy-coupling strength)  
- `p = 2` (memory-depth exponent)  
- `t_max = 10` and `n_steps = 500` for time discretization  

The jump operator `D` is a self-adjoint involution (toy early/late Hawking-pair swap).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buco-duality/QTD-Page-Curve.git
cd QTD-Page-Curve
